Beginning to work with python

This is just me beginning to migrate from R to python. Most of the code on these files will probably be extremelly buggy and useless,
with several copy/paste examples from online tutorials and random changes to better understand the code's structure.

I'll probably try to work around spatial statistics, time series analysis and and bayesian statistics as I get used to the language. 
Eventually I'll try to add the scripts of my monograph on statistics, which was as implementation of Product Partition Model with Gibbs sampling
to model random variables with bivariate normal distribution.
